> [!IMPORTANT]
> Rivo Agent is currently focused on Android. Internet access is required for sign-in, model catalog metadata, and first-time model download. After setup, normal chat inference runs locally on the device.

## About Rivo Agent

Rivo Agent turns a phone into a small offline AI workstation. The app helps users choose a compatible GGUF model, download it to local storage, verify the model file, and run chat inference through `llama.rn`.

The main chat experience is designed for private conversations, coding help, brainstorming, writing support, short local memory, and fast on-device reasoning without sending chat content to a remote model server.

Rivo uses Firebase Auth and Google Sign-In for app access. The assistant conversation itself is handled locally after a model is installed.

## What You Can Do

### Local AI Chat

- Chat with an installed GGUF model directly on your phone.
- Ask questions, write code, brainstorm ideas, and draft text.
- Stream responses with a stop control.
- Copy full messages or individual code blocks.
- Share assistant responses through the native Android share sheet.
- Continue working after setup without cloud model calls for normal replies.

### Model Setup

- Detect device name, RAM, and available storage.
- View compatible models from a curated catalog.
- See recommended models based on phone capability.
- Download models in the background with progress and speed tracking.
- Continue supported downloads when an active task already exists.
- Verify downloaded files by size, readability, and GGUF header.
- Delete local models when storage needs to be freed.

### Local Memory And Threads

- Keep recent chats saved locally on the device.
- Create up to seven local threads.
- Load or delete previous local threads.
- Store short user memory and assistant preferences.
- Compact long conversations into smaller memory notes.
- Use Performance Mode to keep memory usage lighter on lower-end devices.

### Neural Panel

- Rename the assistant.
- Adjust assistant personality.
- Set emoji behavior.
- Add the user's name and memory notes.
- Choose maximum generation tokens.
- Tune active context size.
- Enable or disable Performance Mode.
- View local context and cache status.

### Privacy And Control

- Run model inference on-device after setup.
- Store chat threads, settings, memory, and model metadata locally with `AsyncStorage`.
- Keep downloaded models in the app's Android file directory.
- Clear local state and downloaded model files during logout.
- Use professional confirmation alerts before destructive actions.

## First-Time Flow

1. Open Rivo Agent.
2. Continue from the splash and home screens.
3. Sign in with Google.
4. Let onboarding read device RAM and storage.
5. Choose a recommended or supported model.
6. Wait for the model download and verification to finish.
7. Review the model-ready screen.
8. Enter the chat workspace and start using local AI.

## How Rivo Works

Rivo is a React Native app with native Android support for local model files.

- React Native handles screens, local state, animations, chat UI, and setup flow.
- `llama.rn` loads the selected GGUF file and runs local completions.
- Firebase Auth and Google Sign-In handle app access.
- `AsyncStorage` stores local app state, chat threads, memory, settings, and model metadata.
- `@kesha-antonov/react-native-background-downloader` handles large model downloads.
- `react-native-device-info` reads RAM, storage, and device details for model recommendations.
- A custom Kotlin module verifies, migrates, copies, and deletes model files.
- A custom Kotlin clipboard module supports message and code copying.

Features may be added, removed, renamed, or rebuilt as the product evolves.

## Configuration Notes

Before running the app on a fresh machine, configure these project-specific values:

- Copy `android/app/google-services.example.json` to `android/app/google-services.json`.
- Replace the placeholder Firebase values with the real Firebase Android app configuration.
- Replace `YOUR_WEB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` with the Google web OAuth client id used by Firebase Auth.
- Make sure the Android package name in Firebase is `com.rivoapp`.
- Use your own release keystore before shipping a production APK. The current release build type still points to the debug keystore.

Do not commit private Firebase credentials, release keystores, signing passwords, or production secrets.

## Release Checklist

Before publishing a new Android build:

- Update `android/app/build.gradle` version code and version name.
- Confirm Firebase and Google Sign-In are configured for the release package.
- Replace debug signing with production signing.
- Build and test the APK on a physical Android device.
- Confirm model download, verification, chat, copy, share, logout, and cleanup flows.
- Update the GitHub release tag, APK link, and README release notes.

## Local Development Setup

Use this section to set up the codebase on your PC and start coding.

### 1. Install prerequisites

Install:

- Node.js `22.11.0` or newer.
- npm.
- Java Development Kit compatible with the Android Gradle Plugin.
- Android Studio.
- Android SDK Platform `36`.
- Android Build Tools `36.0.0`.
- Android NDK `27.1.12297006`.
- A physical Android device or Android emulator.
- Xcode and CocoaPods only if you plan to work on the iOS scaffold.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd "Rivo-Agent-Application"
```

If your folder path contains spaces, keep quotes around the path when using shell commands.

### 3. Install mobile dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Add Firebase and Google Sign-In config

```bash
cp android/app/google-services.example.json android/app/google-services.json
```

Then edit `android/app/google-services.json` with the real Firebase project values and update the Google web OAuth client id in `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`.

### 5. Link font assets if needed

Fonts are configured in `react-native.config.js`.

```bash
npx react-native-asset
```

Run this only if fonts are not already present in the native asset folders.

### 6. Start Metro

```bash
npm start
```

Keep Metro running in one terminal.

### 7. Run the Android app

In a second terminal:

```bash
npm run android
```

For a production-style APK build:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The generated APK will be under `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.

### 8. Run tests and checks

```bash
npm test
npm run lint
```

### 9. Run the companion website

```bash
cd "rivo website/frontend"
npm install
npm start
```

The website runs with Create React App and opens on the local development server printed by the terminal.
